# ciarmy.com IP blocklist. Based on information from a 
# network of Sentinel devices deployed around the world, they 
# compile a list of known bad IP addresses. Sentinel devices 
# are uniquely positioned to pick up traffic from bad guys 
# without requiring any type of signature-based or rate-based 
# identification. If an IP is identified in this way by a 
# significant number of Sentinels, the IP is malicious and 
# should be blocked.
